User Story:
- As a traveler, I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that I can plan a trip accordingly.

Design:
- A weather dashboard with form inputs used to search for a city.

FUNctions:
- Current and future conditions for that city and that city is displayed when search button pressed; the city is also added to the search history.
- City Info:
  + City name
  + Current date
  + An icon representation of weather conditions (coming soon)
  + Temperature
  + Humidity
  + Wind speed
  + UV index (presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe: coming soon)

- A 5-day forecast
- Forecast Info:
    + Date
    + Icon representation of weather conditions
    + Temperature
    + Wind speed
    + Humidity

Updates coming soon 
- Whenever the user clicks on a city in the search history they are presented with current and future conditions for that city again
